## ✅ GitHub Repository Update Complete!

### What I've Done:
1. **Fixed Repository Structure**: Moved all files to the root level (removed the nested "project/" directory)
2. **Uploaded All Essential Files**:
   - ✅ `tsconfig.json` - Main TypeScript configuration
   - ✅ `tsconfig.app.json` - Application TypeScript configuration  
   - ✅ `tsconfig.node.json` - Node.js TypeScript configuration
   - ✅ `package.json` - Node.js dependencies
   - ✅ `vite.config.ts` - Vite build configuration
   - ✅ `netlify.toml` - Netlify deployment configuration
   - ✅ `src/` - All source code files
   - ✅ `public/` - Static assets and manifest.json
   - ✅ All other configuration files

### Next Steps:
1. **Verify Upload**: Go to https://github.com/ZChee-git/pwa-video-learning-app
2. **Check Files**: Confirm that `tsconfig.app.json` is now in the repository root
3. **Trigger Netlify Deployment**: 
   - Go to your Netlify dashboard
   - The deployment should automatically trigger, or manually trigger a new build
   - The build should now succeed with the TypeScript configuration files present

### Expected Result:
- ✅ Netlify build should complete successfully
- ✅ Your PWA should be accessible at: https://ebb-player.netlify.app
- ✅ PWA Builder should be able to analyze the site for APK generation

### If Issues Persist:
- Check the Netlify build logs for any remaining errors
- Ensure the correct Node.js version is being used (should be 18 or later)
- The build command should be: `npm run build`
- The publish directory should be: `dist`

The repository is now properly structured and all TypeScript configuration files are in place for successful Netlify deployment!
